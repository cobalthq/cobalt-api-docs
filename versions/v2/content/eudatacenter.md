# EU Data Center

<aside class="notice">
The information provided in this section is specifically tailored for customers who are using our
EU Data center (app.eu.cobalt.io).
</aside>

## Introduction

If you're using our EU Data center (app.eu.cobalt.io) and need to call our API, be aware that the base URL for
API calls will differ from the examples in our documentation, which use the US version.

## Procedure

1. Identify the base URL: The base URL for customers using our EU Data center is https://api.eu.cobalt.io.
   This is the URL you should use when making API calls.
2. Replace the base URL in examples: All examples provided in our documentation use the US version of the base
   URL (https://api.us.cobalt.io). When following these examples, you will need to replace the US
   base URL with the EU base URL.
3. For example, if an API call in the documentation is shown as:

```https://api.us.cobalt.io/example-endpoint```

You should replace it with:

```https://api.eu.cobalt.io/example-endpoint```

By following the steps outlined above, you can ensure that your API calls correctly target our EU Data center.
