# Idempotency

The Cobalt API supports [idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence), which allows you to safely resend
requests without the risk of accidentally performing the same operation twice.
For example, if a request to create an asset doesn't respond due to a network
connection error, you can resend the request with the same idempotency key to ensure that no more than one
asset will be created.

To perform an idempotent request, add the `Idempotency-Key: <key>` header to the request.
We also support the `Mutation-Check` header name to ensure backward compatibility with previous versions of the API.

An idempotency key is a unique value generated by the client. The server uses this key to recognize
subsequent request attempts if the previous attempt failed. You can decide how you want to create unique keys.
We recommend using V4 UUIDs or another random string with enough entropy.

All `POST` requests optionally accept idempotency keys. Idempotency keys are valid for 5 minutes.
