# Idempotency

The API supports [idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. This is useful when an API call is disrupted in transit and you do not receive a response. For example, if a request to create an asset does not respond due to a network connection error, you can retry the request with the same idempotency key to guarantee that no more than one asset is created.

To perform an idempotent request, provide an additional `Idempotency-Key: <key>` header to the request. The header name `Mutation-Check` is also supported for backwards compatibility with previous versions of the API. 

An idempotency key is a unique value generated by the client which the server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request. How you create unique keys is up to you, but we suggest using V4 UUIDs, or another random string with enough entropy to avoid collisions.

All `POST` requests optionally accept idempotency keys. Idempotency keys expire after 5 minutes.
