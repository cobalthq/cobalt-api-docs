# Partner Integrations

If you are developing a partner integration, we encourage you to set a custom `User-Agent` header
identifying your integration in requests to the Cobalt API.
This allows us to identify traffic originating from your integration for analytical and troubleshooting purposes.

Example custom header:
`User-Agent: PartnerCobaltIntegration/1.0.0`
