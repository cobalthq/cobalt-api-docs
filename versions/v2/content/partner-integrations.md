# Partner Integrations

When developing a partner integration, please set a custom `User-Agent` header.
The custom `User-Agent` allows us to identify your integration and the traffic originating from it
for analysis and troubleshooting purposes.

Format:
`User-Agent: [IntegrationName]/[IntegrationVersion]`

Example:
`User-Agent: PartnerCobaltIntegration/1.0.0`

The `User-Agent` header is not required, but we strongly encourage you to send it.
